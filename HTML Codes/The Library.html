            <p class="Content">Fr. Verstraeten Central Library of Excellence Academy plays a pivotal role in the
                teaching-learning process of the College. It is the fulcrum of all academic activities of
                all UG courses and research studies. The Library has a rich collection of around 69,000
                books, old and rare books, valuable reference books, journals, educational CDs/DVDs
                and innumerable e-books, e-journals, and other resources for the use of its members.
                Nobel Laureate Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore once mentioning the significance of
                libraries said,</p> <br>
                <i><p class="Content">"If one could control the age long tumult of the ocean in such a way that it would remain
                    quiet like a child asleep, then that silent, uproar could be compared to a library. Here
                    language remains silent, the mighty waves still, the deathless lustre of the human soul is
                    here enchanted in black print in the prison house of paper. If of a sudden they were to rise
                    in rebellion, break upon the silence and make good their escape through the barrier of
                    print! As many a flood lie congealed in the hard snow in the heights of the Himalayas, so the
                    library encompasses within its narrow limits the mighty torrents of the human soul."</p></i> <br>
