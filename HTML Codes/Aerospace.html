            <h3 class="SubHeading">1) Department of Aerospace Engineering(B.tech)</h3>
            <p class="Content">The department was set up in 1998 leading to B.Tech (Hons.) degree after a
                high power committee appointed by GOI stressed the need for manpower
                training in the field of Aeronautical Engineering. Over the years, the department
                has built up laboratories in the areas of Aerodynamics, Structures, Propulsion,
                System & Controls, Aeromodelling etc. A Centre of Excellence for Composite
                Structures Technology and CFD from 1999, 1988 respectively, funded by ARDB,
                has been established in 1999. Currently, the research efforts of the faculty are
                supported by a large number of projects sponsored by ARDB, ADA, ISRO, DST,
                AICTE, MHRD and many other organisations.</p>
